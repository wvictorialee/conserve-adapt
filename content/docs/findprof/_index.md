Unless you plan to go completely DIY on your window improvement and retrofit project, you are likely to need to engage professionals. 

The Society of Chief Officers of Trading Standards in Scotland (SCOTSS) operates the Scotland Trusted Trader Scheme and runs the [Edinburgh Trusted Trader](https://www.trustedtrader.scot/Edinburgh/vetting-process) scheme in association with the City of Edinburgh Council. However, it's important to be aware that the scheme does NOT check for workmanship. Being on the register says nothing about the traders' knowledge in working on traditional or historic buildings. 

### Qualifications and Accreditations
#### Architects and Conservationists

If you plan to hire an **architect**, you can consult [The Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland (RIAS)](https://www.rias.org.uk/for-the-public) for general advice on choosing an architect and also search for them by postcode (scroll down on the page).

For historic properties, there are architects who have gone through specialist training and received accreditation in conservation. You can search for these **conservation architects** on [this RIAS page](https://www.rias.org.uk/for-the-public/conservation). However, keep in mind that there are also architects without conservation accreditations who nevertheless have experiences in working on traditional and historic buildings.

> [!Note] Note
> The title 'architect' is legally protected. Only professionals on the [UK Architects Registration Board (ARB) Register](https://arb.org.uk/architects-register/) can be called an architect. ARB is a statutory regulator that sets competence standards and publishes Code of Conduct. 
> 
> Many architects also choose to be 'Chartered' with RIAS (in Scotland) or RIBA (elsewhere in the UK). RIAS and RIBA are professional bodies (not regulators) with extra standards and client services.

In addition to or instead of conservation architects, you may wish to engage a **CIAT-Accredited Conservationist**. You can look them up at the [Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists (CIAT)](https://architecturaltechnology.com/online-directories/ciat-accredited-conservationist.html) website. Other historic building-specific specialist Registers can be found at the [Institute of Historic Building Conservation](https://ihbc.org.uk/resources_head/specialist_registers/index.html) website. Please note that these organisations are UK-wide.  

#### Tradespeople
Whilst the profession of architects is statutorily regulated, tradespeople like joiners and glazers are not. However, there are government-approved qualification conservation or energy retrofitting, such as the [Level 3 Award in Energy Efficiency for Older and Traditional Buildings](https://edin.ac/4oTe7WO). Historic Environment Scotland also publishes the [course handbook of this qualification](https://edin.ac/4nEZbud) so you can take a look at the specific knowledge qualified tradespeople would have.  

### What to ask
To choose the right professionals for the job, you'd want to look for demonstrable experience working on traditional and historic properties. Even for regulated professions such as architects, regulation only helps ensure competence and accountability, but it’s not a guarantee of design quality or workmanship. Always ask to see previous works and get at least two estimates. Use the following questions to help you decide who to appoint.

- How many years of experience do you have working on traditional buildings, especially on windows? Could you show me similar projects (photos) or take me to see a recently completed work (from the outside)?
- How do you plan to salvage/retain as much as possible of the original material (e.g. timber frame)? Can you match/retain the astragal (glazing bar) profiles and other details of the original window? What materials (type of wood, paint, etc) will you be using? 
- How will you handle sanding (old paint and putty may contain lead) and other on-site logistics such as protection from dust and security? Will we need scaffolding?
- How long will the work take? When can we start? How will weather affect the progress (e.g. painting)?
- Will you prepare the necessary planning paperwork for me? If not, will you provide the necessary drawings and documentations I need?
- Do you offer any warranty? What if something goes wrong after the work is completed?
