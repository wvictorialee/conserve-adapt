### Books
This section contains detailed reference manuals that are usually intended for tradespeople and conservation professionals. However, you may wish to consult them to learn more about your historic property and/or checking on what the tradespeople have told you. 

These manuals are usually available only in hard copies. Wherever available, I've included link to the Edinburgh Libraries Catalogue where you can check them out yourself. For some manuals it's also possible to purchase a copy from the orgranisation that published it.

- :blue_book: **The Care and Conservation of Georgian Houses: A Maintenance Manual for Edinburgh New Town:** By Andy Davey and others; published by Butterworth-Architecture. The latest edition of this manual is the 4th edition (1995). The [Edinburgh Library](https://edin.ac/4oomokW) has the 3rd edition (1986). The book is no longer in print! But many (professional/heritage and DIY enthusiasts) found this to be very helpful and you may be able to find a used copy online. 

- :blue_book: **Conservation of Timber Sash and Case Windows: Maintaining, Repairing and Improving the Performance of Traditional Windows:** By Stephen Newsom; published by Historic Scotland (2002). Free PDF can be downloaded from the [Historic Environment Scotland website](https://www.historicenvironment.scot/archives-and-research/publications/publication/?publicationId=ae41ad09-7905-42d3-a8dc-a5ad00a3cf26). You can also purchase a hard copy for £6.
