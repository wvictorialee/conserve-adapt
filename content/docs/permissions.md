# Planning Paperwork
## Certificate of Lawfulness (for proposed development)
- Answers the question: Would the proposed work be lawful without planning permission on the facts and the law today?
- To answer this question is to determine whether the proposed work is permitted development (or not “development” at all) – this is an yes/no determination (based on law), with no conditions attached
- Cheaper, faster, and usually no requirement to notify neighbours
- Confirms the proposed work is lawful at the date of the decision 
- Protects against enforcement if the work carried out is exactly as submitted in the original application
- Apply for this if you’re confident the proposed work is PD (or not development at all). In this case you don’t actually even need to apply for a certificate, but the certificate provides legal certainty when you want to sell the property (and also for insurance). 
- If you are not sure the proposed work is PD, you can still apply; but if the answer is no, then you need to go through the planning permission route (or you can appeal to the Scottish Planning and Environmental Appeals Division (DPEA))
>[!Note] Certificate of lawfulness ≠ planning permission; it simply confirms that you don’t need planning permission
