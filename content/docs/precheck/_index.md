Before you decide on what improvement to do to your windows, you would want to make sure that your window problem is not caused by larger issues related to your building as a whole, such as disrepair of the stonework on the exterior of your property, which could lead to leaking and compromise the performance and longevity of any window retrofit.

Use the below worksheet as a guide and do a walk-around check to spot issues that could let water in or trap moisture. Download the worksheet by clicking on the image below.
