What we colloquially call a 'window' in fact contains many different parts and it's possible to retrofit/upgrade/replace them separately. This **elemental approach** can save you money, hassle, and help conserve as much original material as possible - especially important in historic properties. Before you begin, there are some basic retrofitting principles that would be useful to keep in mind.

#### **A building is a system of interacting parts**
- How you decide to retrofit your window may impact other parts of your home. For instance, making your house more airtight means you might need to be more conscious about ventilation, such as opening the windows when you cook or dry the laundry to avoid build-up of condensation and mould.
- You may also want to consider any potential unintended consequences. For instance, would measures that keep in warmth in the winter cause overheating in the summer?
#### **Trapped moisture is the enemy**
- It takes less energy to raise the temperature of air than the temperature of water. So to keep warm is to keep dry. 
- If you have water ingress or any damp part of your building, fix those first before tackling any energy retrofit.
#### **Traditional fabric needs to breathe**
- Older buildings usually use solid walls, lime mortars, and timber that manage moisture by letting it move through.  
- Don’t use anything that will trap moisture, such as any material that won’t allow vapour to move through (e.g. cement or non-breathable finishes) 
#### **Maintain, repair, then improve**
- Buildings back then used better materials that are often no longer available today. This is the reason that most available guidance today would encourage you to keep as much original material as possible. 
- Traditional buildings _are_ higher maintenance than modern buildings. This is just a fact of owning an ‘old’ property. Wooden frames require regular painting every few years, not only to refresh its appearance but also to protect the wood. 
- You want to make sure everything is in good maintenance and good repair before doing energy improvement. Otherwise, your retrofit might not last or won't be as effective. 
- Often, just maintenance and repair can help with improving some energy efficiency already.
