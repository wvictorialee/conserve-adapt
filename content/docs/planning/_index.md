The four most common types of planning application paperwork that you might encounter for window retrofits on a protected property are: **Listed Building Consent (LBC)**, **Planning Permission**, **Prior Approval**, and **Certificate of Lawfulness**. 

Although not typically for window improvement works, other retrofit works may also require a **building warrant**, which confirms that the proposed work meets _safety_ and _technical_ building standards and is therefore separate from planning paperwork that focus on **developments** and how the proposed works affect the special historic and architectural characteristics.  

> [!NOTE] Glossary
> The word **Development** is used in Scottish planning[^1] to refer to _"the carrying out of building, engineering, mining or other operations in, on, over or under land, or the making of any material change in the use of any buildings or other land"_, but NOT building works that _"affect only the interior of the building, or do not materially affect the external appearance of the building"_. 
> 
> **Permitted Developments (PD)** are developments that one can do _without_ permissions (and hence without filing any paperwork). Permitted Development Rights (PDR) are limited in conservation areas, and most PDR do not apply to listed buildings and buildings within World Heritage Sites.[^2]
>
> PDR has recently been updated and expanded for those living in CA. Read about what this means for window alterations from page 73 of the [Planning Circular 1/2024](https://edin.ac/47HT7LC).

For window improvement works in protected properties, the type of planning paperwork needed has to do with two considerations: (1) whether the proposed work is **development** (and if it is, should it be approved); and (2) whether the proposed work will impact the **special character** of the building / conservation area / World Heritage site.

### Listed Building Consent (LBC)
- Only applicable to **Listed Buildings**.
- This particular paperwork deals only with the impact on **special character** and not with **development**. This means that for works that would normally be considered permitted developments (such as replacing windows) or not development at all (such as moving kitchen into the living room to create an open plan[^3]) but could impact the character of the building either _externally_ or _internally_, a LBC could still be required.
- If you are unsure, the only way to find out if an LBC is required for certain is to apply for one.
- Free to apply (no fee attached as of Dec. 2025)

> [!NOTE] Special Character
> Often **character** doesn't just refer to the appearance, but also to the material and use. For instance, the character of a historic window would include the profile of its glazing bars (astragals), glass pane pattern (6x6 or 4x4, etc.), decorative features (e.g. horns), the frame and glazing materials, and opening mechanism (simplex or easy-clean for sash and case windows).

### Planning Permission
- Required if the proposed work is NOT permitted development (PD). Decision on this application deals with the question: should the proposed work (development) be allowed to go ahead? 
- The decision is based on a merit-based judgement made in line with the area's development plans (e.g. Scotland’s [Fourth National Planning Framework](https://www.gov.scot/publications/national-planning-framework-4/[), [Edinburgh City Plan 2030](https://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/cityplan2030)) and take into account [materials considerations](https://www.gov.scot/publications/planning-series-circular-3-2013-development-management-procedures/pages/12/) (e.g. The City of Edinburgh Council’s [Listed Buildings & Conservation Areas guidance document](https://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/conservation-2/listed-buildings), Historic Environment Scotland’s [Managing Change guidance notes](https://www.historicenvironment.scot/archives-and-research/publications/?searchPubText=Managing+Change))
- Confusingly, for _unlisted_ buildings in **conservation areas** and **World Heritage sites**, Planning Permission applications are also used to evaluate the impact on the character of the area/site.
- Requires a fee to apply and usually notification of neighbours.

### Certificate of Lawfulness (for proposed development)
- Answers the question: Would the proposed work be lawful _without_ planning permission on the facts and the law today? To answer this question is to determine if the proposed work is permitted development (or if it is not 'development' at all) 
- Is cheaper to apply than Planning Permission and can receive a decision faster; also usually no need for notification of neighbours.
- Apply for this if you’re confident that the proposed work is PD (or not development at all). In this case you don’t actually need to apply, but the certificate provides legal certainty when you want to sell the property (and also useful evidence for insurance).
- If you are not sure the proposed work is PD, you can still apply; but if the answer is no, then you either have to revise the proposed work or go through the planning permission process.
- Since the Certificate of Lawfulness only deals with the question of development, having it doesn't obviate the need of an LBC if your property is listed and the proposed work impacts its character (e.g. interior works).
> [!Note] Important
> Certificate of lawfulness is NOT planning permission; it simply confirms that you _don’t_ need planning permission. For certain works, such as windows, **Prior Approval** is needed instead, see below.
>
> There's no analogous certificate that confirms LBC is not required.

### Prior Notification/ Prior Approval 
- Often referred to simply as **Prior Approval**
- Is a _'light-touch'_ Planning Permission process; _only_ available for certain alterations (such as windows).
- PDR changes in mid-2024 allow window alterations on the **rear elevation (or side elevations that do not front a road)** of an unlisted building in a **conservation area** to go ahead _without_ restriction and _without_ any required planning paperwork.[^4]
    - But for front elevation windows (and side windows that can be seen from a road), you would need to apply for **Prior Approval** _unless_ your new window matches the existing in appearance and opening mechanism (but _not_ material). Details see Ch.7 of [Planning Circular 1/2024](https://www.gov.scot/publications/circular-1-2024-householder-permitted-development-rights/)
