What we colloquially call a 'window' in fact contains many different parts and it's possible to retrofit/upgrade/replace them separately. This elemental approach can save you money, hassle, and help conserve as much original material as possible - especially important in historic properties. The key is knowing how the different parts work together and their importance in reducing heat loss.  

Remember that the process of determining what parts of your window need retrofitting may not be linear. It's possible that you may need to gather further information before you can make a decision. Do not be discouraged by this process! Some tools on this site can help you through this journey.
