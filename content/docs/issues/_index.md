### Draughts
A common issue with windows is draughtiness. However, not all draughtiness are alike. There are draughts that are due to air leakage (infiltration) through gaps between window elements, such as around the window frames, or between the top and bottom sashes. In some badly-fitted windows the gaps are big and easy to spot. Other times, you may not notice anything by visual inspection but can feel streams of cold air. It’s important to know that infiltration is driven by outside wind speed – the stronger the wind, the more leakage. In Edinburgh on windy days, you may notice the curtains billowing even when the windows are closed – this is a sure sign that you have a draught problem. On calmer days, you can still detect infiltration by using a candle or lighter.

Another type of draught that you may feel when standing close to the window is due to the inside air being cooled by the cold glass panes. The cooled air then drops, creating a downdraught that feels like a breeze even when no outside air is leaking in. This happens because heat is transmitted through the glass panes at a faster rate than through the walls, especially with single-glazing. 

This rate of heat transmittance is expressed as **U-value**, with the unit W/m2K. The higher the U-value a window pane or wall has, the less insulating it is because heat goes through it faster. The typical single-glazing windows panes have a U-value of around 5.2 K/m2K. For reference, the Scottish Building Standards recommend that the window U-value for newly constructed dwellings to be no worse than 1.4 K/m2K.


### Condensation
Windows with a poor U-value will not only have problems with downdraughts, but also condensation. Condensation happens when the warm and moist air in the room meets the cold window pane. Warm air can hold more moisture, therefore when the air is cooled by the glass pane, the water is condensed out.

Condensation issues happen the most in the winter because of the temperature difference between the inside and the surface of the glass, but also because in the winter we tend to keep our windows shut and therefore reduce ventilation in the home. Moisture from people breathing, cooking, laundry drying, washing up, etc. can all contribute to the indoor humidity build up.

Condensation is obviously a nuisance as it obstructs the view. If it’s bad enough such that you have to wipe or vacuum them away on a daily basis in the winter, then it’s also an unpleasant chore. More importantly, condensation can cause mould that not only negatively affects your health but also damage the timber frame and give it a ‘dirty’ look.

It’s normal to have some condensation in the winter especially around dawn. This should naturally evaporate as the sun comes up. Dripping condensation and heavily fogged windows, however, should not happen and need to be investigated.  

### Rattling & Noise
Windows with single-glazing would let in more noise because there’s only one thin sheet of glass between you and the outside. Sound (such as traffic noise) hits it and makes it vibrate like a drum skin, and those vibrations pass straight into the room. This is why thicker glass and double-glazing will also improve acoustic comfort.

In addition, because sound travels via air, any small gaps around the window frame also allow outside noise to leak in (along with the air). For this reason, you would also want to make sure that there is a good seal/draughtproofing around the windows and between the movable window parts.

Historic windows are made of timber that can shrink or warp, causing window parts (such as the sashes) to no longer fit snugly. This can lead to the window rattling in the wind, contributing to noise issues. 

### Difficult to Open or to Keep Open
Many historic windows are large. Even with just single-glazing, these timber-framed windows can be quite heavy to open. Often on the bottom of the lower sash there are two ring pulls/lifts (part of the window's ironmongery) that one can insert fingers into to lift the sash. Unfortunately, these little rings force a weak grip and an awkward wrist angle, so you don't get proper leverage or a comfortable body position to push the bottom sash up. The awkward position can be especially difficult for the elderly or anyone with mobility issues. 

Not able to open the window easily may not be a big issue in the winter. Indeed, some windows are painted shut entirely (especially the top sash). But an inoperable window can be a nuisance in the summer, especially if the room receives direct sunlight and risks being overheated. At any time, it can also be an inconvenience to not be able to open the window to ventilate, such as when cooking or drying laundry.

Some windows, even when they can be open, the sashes would slide out of position. This is usually due to worn pulleys, incorrect weights, and/or frayed sash cords. These issues can be fixed by having the window refurbished. 

### Leaks or Rotted/Peeling Wood 
Any leak around the window should be considered a serious issue. Often water ingress are accompanied by rotted wood, peeling paint, and mould around the window (including the frame and windowsill). These issues should be investigated to make sure it is not due to stonework defects that need to be fixed before any window retrofit can begin.
