The terms traditional, historic, and listed buildings are often used interchangeably although they don’t always mean the same thing. 

**Traditional buildings** are defined by [Scotland’s Building Standard](https://www.gov.scot/collections/building-standards/) as buildings constructed before or around 1919. 

**Listed buildings** are buildings determined to have special architectural or historic interests and are protected under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Act 1997. Oftentimes, these building are traditional buildings, but buildings younger than 1919 can also have historic significance. 

There is no official definition for **historic buildings**, but in this site I use the term generally to include listed buildings and buildings that are in Conservation Areas. Most (but not all) listed buildings are also located within a conservation area in Edinburgh.
