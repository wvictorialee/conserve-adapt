This section contains detailed reference manuals that are usually intended for tradespeople and conservation professionals. However, you may wish to consult them to learn more about your historic property and/or checking on what the tradespeople have told you. 

These manuals are usually available only in hard copies. Wherever available, I've included link to the Edinburgh Libraries Catalogue where you can check them out yourself. For some manuals it's also possible to purchase a copy from the orgranisation that published it.
