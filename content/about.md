This website was created and written by Dr W. Victoria Lee from the University of Edinburgh. 

Between 2023-2025 I led several research projects[^1] on understanding the conservation and adaptation process of historic homes in Edinburgh, with a particular focus on sash and case windows. Some of these works were in collaboration with the City of Edinburgh Council (CEC) and Edinburgh World Heritage (EWH). Across these projects I've spoken with 100+ owner-occupiers who have undertaken (or attempted) retrofit works, as well as several heritage specialists, architects, and planners. 

I distilled some of what I've learned into plain-language information to help residents navigate the process of window retrofits and related works in historic homes. Whilst the primary focus is on windows and the Edinburgh context, many principles apply to other elements of the home and to elsewhere in Scotland and the wider UK.  

The content of this site is based on my research and reflects my own understanding and interpretation of current policies and good-practice guidance for historic buildings. The information provided is offered in good faith. It is not official guidance from the University of Edinburgh, the City of Edinburgh Council, or Edinburgh World Heritage; and is not a substitute for professional advice.

Every building is different! Always consider the specific condition and significance of your property, and check the latest requirements with your local planning authority before proceeding. 

Please let me know if you have suggestions for improvement by filling out a short anonymous [feedback survey]({{<relref "docs/feedback/_index.md">}}). You can also contact me via email (historic.voices@ed.ac.uk). Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) was _not_ used in the writing of the content. Therefore, there may be typographical errors. Please let me know if you've spotted any. 

Thanks for visiting!
